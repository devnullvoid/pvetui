## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Pluggable feature architecture for UI contributions with runtime registration and lifecycle management.
- Community Scripts functionality extracted into the `community-scripts` plugin; enable it via the `plugins.enabled` setting.
- Demo "guest list" plugin that adds a node action presenting running guests in a modal.
- LRU (Least Recently Used) cache eviction with configurable size limits to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- Configurable API retry count via `DefaultRetryCount` constant for easier tuning.

### Changed
- Plugins are now disabled by default; update configuration to opt into optional features such as community scripts.
- Configuration files now honour the `plugins.enabled` list instead of falling back to legacy defaults.
- Cache implementation now uses `json.RawMessage` to eliminate double JSON marshaling/unmarshaling overhead.
- FileCache now implements LRU eviction with doubly-linked list for efficient cache management.

### Fixed
- Allow post-operation refreshes to run by clearing VM pending state before triggering automatic data reloads after lifecycle actions.
- Removed potential password exposure from authentication debug logs.
- Fixed race condition in `AuthManager.GetValidToken()` method with improved locking pattern.
- Added HTTP request timeouts to all API methods (30-second default) to prevent indefinite hangs.
- BadgerDB goroutine leak fixed with proper cleanup channel for background garbage collection.
- Lock file handling vulnerability fixed with proper PID validation to prevent cache corruption.
- File permissions in test files changed from 0o644 to 0o600 for better security.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- **VM Action Protection System**: Comprehensive protection mechanism to prevent VM actions while operations are pending
  - **Context Menu Protection**: Lifecycle actions (start, stop, restart, delete, migrate) are hidden when VMs have pending operations
  - **Keyboard Shortcut Protection**: Shell, VNC, and context menu shortcuts are blocked for VMs with pending operations
  - **Visual Indicators**: Pending VMs show dimmed status with special indicators
  - **Menu Title Updates**: Context menu titles show current pending operation status (e.g., "Guest Actions (Starting)")
  - **Snapshot Protection**: Create, delete, and rollback snapshot operations are blocked while VMs have pending operations
  - **Configuration Protection**: VM config editing and storage resizing are blocked during pending operations
  - **Migration Protection**: Migration dialog is blocked for VMs with pending operations
  - **Refresh Protection**: Individual VM refresh and global refresh are blocked while operations are pending
  - **Auto-Refresh Protection**: Auto-refresh cannot be enabled while there are pending operations
  - **Helper Functions**: Added `CanVMPerformActions()` and `GetVMPendingOperation()` for easier pending state checking
  - **Thread-Safe Operations**: All pending state operations use proper mutex protection for concurrent access

### Fixed
- **VM Pending State Timing**: Fixed visual glitch where deleted VMs would briefly return to "normal" state before being removed
  - **Delete Operations**: VMs now stay in pending state until refresh completes and they're removed from the UI
  - **Migration Operations**: VMs stay in pending state until refresh shows them in their new location
  - **Consistent Behavior**: All operations now maintain pending state until refresh operations complete
  - **Better User Experience**: Users can see VMs remain in pending state until operations truly complete

## [1.0.5] - 2025-08-24

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGE
- **Project Renamed to pvetui**
  - Rename was necessary in order to remain compliant with Proxmox trademark
  - Old paths referencing `proxmox-tui` must be renamed to `pvetui`. For example:
    ```
    mv ~/.config/proxmox-tui ~/.config/pvetui
    ```
  - **Additional migration steps:**
    - Update any shell aliases or scripts referencing the old binary name
    - Update any systemd service files or cron jobs
    - Update any documentation or bookmarks referencing the old project name
    - **Environment Variables:** Change prefix from `PROXMOX_` to `PVETUI_` (e.g., `PROXMOX_HOST` → `PVETUI_HOST`)
  - **Impact:** This change affects configuration paths, binary names, environment variables, and all project references

### Added
- **Multi-platform Package Distribution**: Added comprehensive support for distributing pvetui through multiple package managers
- **32-bit builds**: Add official 32-bit binaries by request in [#25](https://github.com/devnullvoid/pvetui/issues/25)
  - Linux: `linux/386`
  - Windows: `windows/386`
  - Included in GoReleaser config and local Makefile release target

  - **AUR Support**: Complete Arch User Repository integration with automated PKGBUILD generation and management
  - **Homebrew Tap**: macOS and Linux distribution via Homebrew with automated formula updates
  - **Scoop Bucket**: Windows distribution via Scoop with automated manifest management
  - **DEB/RPM Packages**: Traditional Linux package formats automatically generated by GoReleaser
  - **Docker Images**: Multi-platform container images published to GitHub Container Registry
  - **Orchestration Scripts**: Unified management of all package managers through a single command interface
  - **Automated Updates**: Scripts to automatically update package definitions with new versions and checksums
  - **Local Testing**: Built-in testing and validation for all package formats before publishing
  - **Makefile Integration**: New targets for package manager operations (setup, update, status, clean)
  - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete guide covering setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting for all platforms

### Documentation
- **README Updates**: Fixed CLI argument conventions and improved documentation
  - Updated all CLI examples to use correct double-dash format (`--config` instead of `-config`)
  - Added comprehensive CLI reference table with all available flags and short versions
  - Fixed broken anchor links in navigation for better user experience
  - Replaced problematic emojis with compatible ones for consistent anchor generation
  - Updated project title to 'TUI for Proxmox Virtual Environment' for trademark compliance
  - Added trademark disclaimer to clarify non-affiliation with Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH
  - Enhanced demo section with both GIF (GitHub compatible) and WebM (high quality) options
  - Fixed CLI examples throughout all documentation files for consistency

## [1.0.4] - 2025-08-19

### Added
- **Guest name editing**: Added ability to change QEMU VM names and LXC container hostnames from the config page
  - QEMU VMs: Edit the "name" field which updates the VM display name
  - LXC containers: Edit the "hostname" field which updates the container hostname
  - Real-time title updates show the new name as you type
  - Changes are saved to Proxmox and reflected immediately in the UI
  - Input validation prevents invalid hostname characters (underscores, spaces, special chars)
  - Validates hostname format (no leading/trailing hyphens, proper length limits)
  - Fixed UI refresh issue with professional polling approach that verifies API changes before refreshing
  - Added loading indicators during API propagation delay for better user experience
  - Enhanced header component with ShowWarning method for better user feedback
  - Refactored polling functionality into dedicated function for improved maintainability
  - Fixed race condition by polling both config and cluster resources endpoints to ensure complete propagation
- **Cross-platform config and cache paths**: Added native support for Windows config/cache directories
  - Windows: Config in `%APPDATA%/pvetui`, Cache in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/pvetui`
  - macOS: Uses XDG-style paths (`~/.config/pvetui`, `~/.cache/pvetui`) for consistency with other TUI applications
  - Linux: Maintains existing XDG support (`~/.config/pvetui`, `~/.cache/pvetui`)
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing XDG functions
  - Environment variables still override platform defaults when set

### Breaking Changes
- **Windows users only**: Existing config files in XDG-style paths need to be moved to new platform-specific locations
  - **Windows**: Move from `~/.config/pvetui/` to `%APPDATA%/pvetui/`
  - **macOS/Linux**: No changes required - existing paths continue to work
  - The application will automatically use the new paths on first run after this update

### Fixed
- Community Scripts: returning from installation no longer blanks the screen. The selector now closes before refresh and a brief post-resume delay ensures stable UI restore.
- Data Refresh: new containers/VMs created by community scripts are shown immediately without restarting. After install we trigger a hard refresh (cache cleared) and the manual refresh rebuilds the guest list from fresh cluster data.
- Header: eliminated brief spinner flash that could reappear after success/error messages.
- Manual Refresh stability: VM list now rebuilt strictly from cluster resources; filtering preserved across consecutive refreshes; removed VM details flicker and selection jump by stabilizing selection and suppressing programmatic callbacks during list rebuild.
- VM delete selection fallback: after deleting a VM, selection now moves to the first remaining VM and the details panel updates accordingly; clears details when the list becomes empty.
- Manual Refresh optimization: refactored complex refresh logic into separate functions for better maintainability; reduced UI update calls and improved incremental node enrichment; fixed regression where VM list would become empty after refresh due to enriched nodes not preserving VM data from original cluster resources.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-08-09

### Added
- **Guest power actions:** Added Shutdown (graceful), Stop (force), and Reset (hard, QEMU-only) alongside Restart/Start in the guest context menu, with clear confirmations and shortcuts.

### Fixed
- **Windows: Saving profiles could fail with "The system cannot find the path specified"**
  - Ensure config directory creation uses OS-agnostic path handling when saving from the config/profile wizards and menu actions.
  - Fixes saving when adding/editing profiles and when setting default profile on Windows.
- **Windows: Locally built binaries sometimes failed to start**
  - Align local Windows builds with release artifacts by disabling CGO and using baseline CPU target.
  - Scoped compatibility flags to Windows/amd64 only to avoid affecting other platforms.
- **UI: Reduce noisy page removal errors in logs**
  - Remove pages only when present to avoid benign "Failed to remove … page" errors.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed
- **Profile Switching: Separate Active vs Default profile**
  - Introduced a non-persisted runtime `ActiveProfile` distinct from the persisted `default_profile` in config.
  - Switching profiles in the UI now updates only the active profile; the default indicator and config file are not overwritten.

  - Uses scrollable text area for long VNC URLs to prevent UI overflow and improve readability
  - Improved dialog positioning and width to properly display long URLs without truncation
  - Enhanced button focus and keyboard handling (Enter/Escape) for proper dialog dismissal
  - Clarifies that the VNC server is still running and ready for connection
  - Prevents confusing situation where VNC server starts but browser doesn't open

- **Search**: Pressing `ESC` in the search bar now clears the filter text in addition to closing the bar, providing a more intuitive, VIM-like experience.

### Improved
- **Docker**: The Docker instructions have been completely revamped for clarity and correctness, now recommending `docker compose run --rm pvetui` for an improved user experience.
- Robust selection restoration for both VM and Node lists after per-item and global refreshes. Selection is now always restored by name, not index, fixing issues with selection jumping to the top after refreshes.

## [v0.8.0]

### Added

  - New `make vet` target for running Go's built-in static analyzer
  - New `make code-quality` target combining `go vet` and `golangci-lint` for comprehensive checks
  - CI now runs `go vet` before `golangci-lint` to catch additional issues early

## [0.7.1] - 2025-07-01

### Fixed
- **noVNC Files Embedding**: Fixed noVNC files to be properly embedded in compiled binary using Go's `//go:embed` directive instead of runtime filesystem access
- **Windows URL Truncation**: Fixed VNC URLs being truncated in Windows browser address bar by replacing `cmd /c start` with `rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler` to avoid command line length limitations
